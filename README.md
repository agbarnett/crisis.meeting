# What can researchers do to improve research quality in health and medical research in Australia?
Planning for a 2019 meeting on the reproducibility crisis in Australia.

**Location**:
Confirmed as QUT, Gardens Point Theatre

**Date**:
Monday 8th April 2019

**Summary**: 
An estimated 85% of spending on health and medical research is avoidably wasted. 

The day will be split into two parts. The first half will be spent hearing about some of the problems, and then the afternoon will be small groups discussing potential policies. Hopefully at the end of the day we will have one or two policies that we agree the research community will support and that would help reduce research waste.
