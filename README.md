# What can researchers do to improve research quality in health and medical research in Australia?
Planning for a 2019 meeting on the reproducibility crisis in Australia.

**Location**:
Confirmed as QUT, Gardens Point Theatre

**Date**:
Monday 8th April 2019

**Summary**: 
An estimated 85% of spending on health and medical research is avoidably wasted. Waste occurs at all stages of the research process:
* Systematic reviews are too rarely used leading to poorly planned research or unncessary replications
* Many study designs fail to include basic bias-reduction techniques such as blinding
* Around 50% of funded research is never published, possibly because the results were disappointing or the researchers ran out of time
* Around 50% of published papers are incompletely written-up, making it impossible for others to build on the research or for the research to be translated into practice
* Translating research into practice is currently a low priority and researchers often do not have the time or skills to translate their research

The "publish or perish" maxim leads to corner cutting in order to be the first.

The day will be split into two parts. The first half will be spent hearing about some of the problems, and then the afternoon will be small groups discussing potential policies. Hopefully at the end of the day we will have one or two policies that we agree the research community will support and that would help reduce research waste.
