**Notes from Joshau Wallach about their US meeting in 2018**

https://publichealth.yale.edu/ehs/research/conferences/reproducibility/

The meeting was a bit tricky - we had a diverse group of speakers and participants, which made it difficult to focus on a common goal. Our full schedule can be found here: https://publichealth.yale.edu/ehs/research/conferences/reproducibility/schedule.aspx.

Although we told the speakers the exact amount of time that they had for their presentations, many went over their allotted times. This decreased the total amount of time for group discussions.

It was good having different stakeholders with different opinions in one room, but it becomes more challenging when the goal is to plan for next steps.

If I were to re-plan this meeting, I would come in with something drafted in terms of a product/next steps. For instance, one of the questions that we had for discussion was "What are practices that can be widely endorsed?". I think it would have been useful to have action items/a blueprint for modification, discussion, and eventual endorsement.

I also realized that it is best to have internal moderators for each session. This makes it easy to meet/discussion before the symposium and keep the discussions centered on the key issues. Although I had email discussions about the main topic areas with the participants, I think should have had phone/skype calls with each speaker to discuss the key points prior to the meeting.

I hope this is not too much detail! What are your goals for the meeting? Looking forward to hearing more!
