If a simple, number based system of measuring impact could be developed it would probably assume as much importance as the measurement of publications and citations—but nobody has developed such a system; and it’s almost certainly impossible to do so. Thus a near consensus has been reached that “narratives with numbers” is the best method.  https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2018/07/30/richard-smith-measuring-research-impact-rage-hard-get-right/      It’s Time to Make Business School Research More Relevant  https://hbr.org/2018/07/its-time-to-make-business-school-research-more-relevant      ...Many universities are “waking up to the fact that the PhD is not a good training model for academics.”    ...in Australia once somebody leaves the publishing cycle it is generally harder to come back in.”  http://campusmorningmail.com.au/news/in-conversation-with-tanya-monro/      Research Excellence and Scholarly Publishing  https://soundcloud.com/user-466792516/research-excellence-and-scholarly-publishing      Why don't more low-quality patents get rejected? A recent paper published by the Brookings Institution offers fascinating insights into this question. Written by legal scholars Michael Frakes and Melissa Wasserman, the paper identifies three ways the patent process encourages approval of low-quality patents:    • The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is funded by fees—and the agency gets more fees if it approves an application.    • Unlimited opportunities to refile rejected applications means sometimes granting a patent is the only way to get rid of a persistent applicant.    • Patent examiners are given less time to review patent applications as they gain seniority, leading to less thorough reviews.  https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/these-experts-figured-out-why-so-many-bogus-patents-get-approved/    https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/03/theranos-how-a-broken-patent-system-sustained-its-decade-long-deception/      In peer review we (don't) trust: How peer review's filtering poses a systemic risk to science  https://www.researchers.one/article/2018-09-17      Ten myths around open scholarly publishing  https://peerj.com/preprints/27580/        What about scientists complaining about a system that is trying to micromanage them? Is the new assessment system we are promoting serving us better than the old system?   We don’t want all academics to be writing only for academics, but that should still be an important part of their work. Discovery-led science is still something we want to support. What we are talking about is about finding the right balance. And across Europe, in the US and in many other countries, we’re seeing a shift towards more applied and impact-oriented research.    If we tip the balance so far that suddenly there’s not enough discovery-led science taking place, it would be damaging. To keep that balance right is a perennial question of research policy. There’s no correct answer.        Any guidelines on how to keep that balance?  If we take a step back and we consider the scale of the scientific academic enterprise, the extent to which it has grown over the past 30 years, I think it’s right to ask the question: are we seeing a corresponding increase in the contribution of that activity to meeting the really pressing needs of our economy and society? That’s the big policy funding question. Of course, people are going to be nervous and resistant to changing the incentive system, but more must be done to ensure that the investment that we, as countries, are making in science and research is really delivering what we need.  https://observatoriosociallacaixa.org/en/-/entrevist-james-wildson","Not buy into the perverse incentives of 'prestige pandering' (or 'academic wankery') in academia. Read a typical min-bio of a senior academic and it's often about academic credentials and traditional esteem measures (that are obscure to the general public), not what genuine benefits the research has had for the wider community, which includes training other researchers and the impact that has had on their lives and beyond. For example:     ""He was eminent in his field.

Good Clinical Practice training; data management/statistical methods knowledge - not just 'how to' but 'why' as well to ensure that practices such as mining for p values and poor research conduct is discouraged). I know this won't stamp it out entirely, but it would be a start. Journals also need to get tougher with authors and need to ask for more proof that the study has been conducted rigorously. ","We engage a statistician at the very outset to ensure methodological rigour. We have recently started engaging more with patients to ensure that our outcomes are patient important. The initial research idea comes from the clinical area we work in (through communications with clinicians to identify clinical practices in need of improvement/refinement; or analysis of patient safety data/sentinel events) - so hopefully the research is relevant to clinicians who are caring for the patients, and the patients themselves.","None - which is appalling. There are no minimum requirements set at an institutional level - the onus is wholly and solely on the investigator to ensure that they do the right thing, and unfortunately there are investigators who are only driven by publications and accolades, with only passing acknowledgement to how their research will improve things for patients.
